Hello,

I'm not sure what the issue was with my first submission.
I ran all of the git commands, which created a repository on git.

You can see it at: https://github.com/dougpereira/ass1_webarch_coursera
I then downloaded the entire repository in a zip file, and uploaded that. 

The feedback said that it wasn't a git repository. Can you please say more?

It's not clear to me what I did wrong since I downloaded the application directly
from github as per the instructions.

Thanks,
Doug
